1. voltage sensor => voltage divider => On ADC
2. current sensor => some current sensor on proteus (ACS712) => On ADC
3. LCD to display reading
4. Menu switches  => to display voltage/current/power/energy readings 
						(either display them on the screen together or switch with a button)
				  => Reset button
				  => Inst/RMS View
				  => # just a suggestion:
						write reading log on E2PROM or sth
				  
5. for energy calculations => use timer to calculate it in Wh

----------------------------------------------------------------
To Do:
1. HAL voltage sensor => outputs ready-to-use Voltage reading
2. HAL current sensor => outputs ready-to-use Current reading
3. Adjusting LCD HAL to print/manage 4 inputs (voltage/current/power/energy)
4. Configure buttons on EXTI pins (Switch reading---debatable--- && Reset && Inst/RMS)
5. API for energy calculations => (using timer)
6. API for power calculations  => (use V and I reading to calculate power)
7. Test!

EXTRA:
	Operate LCD using I2C

Voltage/Current Sensor HAL Driver (Osama=>.c) (Ahmed=>.h)

Display Interface (LCD + Buttons) => LCD Driver adjustment + EXTI menu buttons (Mostafa)
Calculations (Power && Energy) => Timer for calculating energy (Marawan)
